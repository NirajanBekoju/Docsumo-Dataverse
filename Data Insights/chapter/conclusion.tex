\chapter{Conclusion}
Text data analysis helped determining various parameters like maximum padding length and vocab size. Similarly, word cloud, N-gram exploration, Named Entity Recognition Data, Part of Speech Tagging made more clear about the training data that we were working on which eventually improves the model learning capability.

The best model we have is transformer version 1 with accuracy 0.88, macro average(f1-score) of 0.69 and weighted average of 0.87.
